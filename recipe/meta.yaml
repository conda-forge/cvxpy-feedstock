  summary: A Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization problems
  description: |
    CVXPY is a Python-embedded modeling language for convex optimization
    problems. It allows you to express your problem in a natural way that
    follows the math, rather than in the restrictive standard form required
    by solvers.
